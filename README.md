## Synopsis

Scrummage is a web application that allows a development team to create, modify, update feature/tasks for a created project.  A feature is created with a title, description and points(based on difficulty).  It is then added web app's storyboard that displays the status of each feature - "Backlog" "Progress" or "Completed"

Scrummage keeps track of these points and visually represents the team's progress in a [Burndown chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn_down_chart).

Abiding by the agile practices, Scrummage is a project management solution.  

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

In a work environment where communication is important and organization is vital, we wanted to create a real time app that can keep track of both as well as measure progress.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
