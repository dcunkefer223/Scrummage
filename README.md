## Synopsis

<<<<<<< HEAD
At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)
=======
Scrummage is a web application that allows a development team to create, modify, update feature/tasks for a created project.  A feature is created with a title, description and points(based on difficulty).  It is then added to the storyboard that displays the status of each feature - "Backlog" "Progress" or "Completed"
